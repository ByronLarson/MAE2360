Problem 1

Reads two real numbers from the keyboard and prints their product.

#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
float a, b;  /* to declare that a and b are real variables */
printf("Enter two real numbers separated by space =");
scanf("%d %d", &a, &b); /* reads two real numbers and assign them to a and b */
printf("The product of the two numbers is %d.\n", a*b); /* %d is for integer format*/
return 0;
}




Problem 2

Reads a real number and outputs its inverse. If 0 is read, writes a warning message and quit.

#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    
float a,b;

printf("Enter a number = ");

scanf("%f", &a);
if (a==0.0) 
    printf("You entered 0.\n"); 
else 
    printf("The inverse is:%f.\n",b=1/a);
return 0;
}



Problem 3

Reads a real number, x, and outputs its sine, i.e. sin x. You need to use math.h and the -lm compile option.
