Problem 1
By reviewing the lab note, do the following:
1. Draw a graph of sin(x3) for - π < x < π.
2. Draw a graph of (sin x, sin 2x, sin 3x) for 0 < x < 2π together.
3. Draw a 3-D plot of x*x + sin y




Problem 2
Write a C program to generate the following table of
f(x) = x - x3/6 + x5/120
from x = 0 to x = 4.0 with an increment of 0.1, and store the result to a separate 
file, table.dat


Transfer the above date file from omega.uta.edu to a local folder. 
Launch gnuplot to read the file, table.dat, and plot the data along with sin x. This 
way, you can find out how good approximating sin x by the first three terms of 
Taylor series is. The graph should look like
